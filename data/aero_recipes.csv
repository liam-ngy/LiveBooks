AeroPress Espresso,"<div id=""recipeDescription"" class=""w-full max-w-3xl prose text-black""><p>How to make Espresso with an Aeropress - there are many different opinions on how best to do this. I&#39;ve tried all of them. The most important concept when it comes to espresso is pressure, and there&#39;s only one way to make pressure with an Aeropress.</p><p>The method I use for making an &#39;espresso&#39; with the Aeropress is simple but leaves room for adjustments and experimentation. How long you &#39;pre-infuse&#39; (or bloom) your coffee will have an impact. Whether you decide to do this inverted or not will have an impact. Whether you use a metal screen or not will have an impact. In the end, the most important thing is that you are using high pressure and a fine grind.</p><p>This AeroPress recipe uses a paper filter, but I urge you to try with a metal filter too if you have one.</p><p>For a more comprehensive walkthrough with explanation, check out Coffee Lovers TV original video here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGJ-QzTbjc"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAGJ-QzTbjc</a></p><p><strong>Tried this recipe?

"Low effort, big reward","<div id=""recipeDescription"" class=""w-full max-w-3xl prose text-black""><p>This AeroPress recipe can take up to 20 minutes to brew, but if you have time it is worth trying out... get it started then fry some eggs, take a shower or pack the kids lunches; you&#39;ll be well rewarded with an amazingly smooth and flavorful cup of coffee.</p><p>In a world where a lot of AeroPress recipes seem quite similar in nature, this recipe is refreshingly unique.</p><p><strong>Scroll right down for step by step walk through the recipe.</strong></p><p>The below is quoted from the original thread on Reddit (<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/8m08ge/comment/dzjzsyv/?st=JJMP7CLM&amp;sh=c66ca8af"">which you can read here</a>)</p><p>&quot;What you&#39;re left with is an incredibly rich, clean, and full bodied extract without any bitterness that I haven&#39;t been able to replicate any other way. You get all of the bright notes of the beans, but also the darker earthy and chocolate notes from the entire bean. You can then either drink as is for a rich brew or dilute with boiled water to taste.</p><p>I have found that this method doesn&#39;t overextract. You&#39;ll have to try it for yourself... but it makes an amazingly smooth and flavorful cup. My method emphasizes not overly disturbing the coffee bed - I&#39;m interested in the natural diffusion of the flavors rather than any forceful extraction. I don&#39;t stir the bed or the bloom with any utensil, but rather focus on agitating with a gentle swirl - the bit of water on the bottom before the grounds go in help ensure I get full immersion without too much mucking around. The short bloom then just helps with degassing, then the pour to the top gets the brewing started. After a minute, the grounds have really soaked up the water and have started to swell up.</p><p>After I flip the aeropress right side up, I can immediately see the grinds start to flocculate to the bottom creating a secondary filter bed. I swirl gently to get any wayward grinds into the aeropress before I take off the plunger. At this point I remove all of the foam off the top because I&#39;ve found that&#39;s where a lot of the muddy flavors sit. At this point, the coffee has already started draining into my cup. This coffee is usually really bright and fruity since it&#39;s been about a minute or two into extraction. I often will top up the aeropress to the top, being careful not to disturb the grounds at all. I&#39;ve stuck my spoon to taste the coffee towards the end of the drip, and the heavier earth tones are extracted later on into the brew. Because there is very minimal disturbance to the grounds once you set this up, you don&#39;t get any forced extractions of bitter flavors. The fine grounds are actually key to this brew method I think since it slows the speed the water is going through the bed, again making diffusion rather than extraction the emphasis here.</p><p>When the coffee is done extracting, it&#39;s still pretty warm.</p><p>It also makes a mean iced coffee.</p><p>Like I said, I haven&#39;t been able to recreate this flavor profile using any other method... give it a try and let me know what you think.&quot;</p><p><em><strong>Tried it?

Congratulations Tuomas!</p><p>📍This recipe uses <strong>two rinsed paper filters</strong>;</p><p>Tuomas mentioned a few key points about his recipe on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/Ca2ZRPFtaAd/"">Instagram</a>. If you want to try this recipe at home it will be helpful to read the following tips first:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I just wanna clarify a few things about the recipe so everyone can get hands-on with it! 😎</p><p>1. Water profile! 💦</p><p>Because of the nature of this year&#39;s competition, everyone used distilled water with @thirdwavewater minerals creating their own water profile. There were 14 different variations to choose from and I was the only one who used 100% espresso profile. I think this is one of the biggest reasons why my brew stood out.</p><p>Of course, I tried different variations and I think (especially in this competition coffee) this water profile gave the most balanced taste of sour and sweet, which I was going for. So give it a try and see how it changes the whole coffee versus to regular tap water!</p><p>2. Grind size! ✨</p><p>This was a pain in the arse when submitting the recipe. When I were creating my recipe I was using <strong>@comandantegrinder (27 clicks is what I used!)</strong> to get the most precise grind size. Yes, we got these templates where you can see the grind size from 0 to 9 of the coffee grinded with @macapgrinders . But still, it was very difficult to choose the right one. So it was quite a rough guess.</p><p>Even though, I think the correct grind size is one the most important factors in the recipe!</p><p>3.WAC coffee! ☕️</p><p>This awesome and complex coffee from @bureaux.coffee was really light roasted. When I first tried it, I brewed it with my Finnish Championship recipe. It came out with this not-so-pleasant sour taste which you can compare to tannins in red wine. How to get that astrigency off of the brew there are few things to bear in mind. Water temperature, grind size and agitation. Everything you can find from my Finnish AP recipe.</p><p>So what comes to this WAC recipe, I found the best balance in the other extremity - medium+ coarse grind, low water temperature and little agitation.</p><p>When making this brew, be gentle with it. Hope you guys enjoy! ❤️</p></blockquote><p><strong>Tried it?

Start a timer, and pour 100°C water until the AeroPress is filled — this is about 260 grams of water, or a bit more, because some water will drip.
Using a spoon or the plastic stick that comes with the AeroPress, stir in a back and forth motion from the complete bottom of the dripper all the way to the top. Avoid circular stirs !
Place the plunger a few millimeters deep onto the AeroPress chamber. This will cause a bit of water to escape; don’t sweat it.

Prismo Full Immersion Brew,"<div id=""recipeDescription"" class=""w-full max-w-3xl prose text-black""><p>Prismo is an AeroPress® attachment that unlocks espresso-style coffee without an espresso machine.

You can even switch up your regular ol’ coffee routine by using Prismo for a full immersion brew.</p><p><strong>How is this different than normal AeroPress® coffee using the inversion method?</strong></p><p>One of Prismo’s coffee superpowers is its “No Drip Seal”. Prismo creates a perfect seal inside the AeroPress chamber, so once you load in your coffee and grinds, there’s no worries about coffee leaking out the bottom. Play with different grind sizes and immersion times to coax out the best flavor from your favorite beans. Plus, once your coffee is done, when you press through Prismo’s Pressure Actuated Valve, the coffee is aerated as it passes through. Resulting in less bitterness and a smoother, creamier cup.</p></div>",Experimental,"Standard, 1:30, Metal Filter","28g, Fine, Your favourite beans","97°C / 206°F, 84mL","Twist Prismo onto the bottom of your AeroPress® Coffee Maker.

If you taste it right away, it’ll be good, but the body won’t be there. After it has set for about 1-2 minutes, the body will ramp up. At about 63°C/145<strong>°F</strong>, it is a huge, creamy, and almost chewy. The cup will also be crazy sweet.</p><p>Give it a try and leave a comment if you enjoy it!</p><p><strong>The Theory:</strong></p><p>At the particle level of coffee extraction there are two types of solubles: surface solubles and inner cell solubles. Surface solubles extract very easily. They also give coffee its sweetness. Think of how sweet and syrupy cold brew is…that’s because it is pretty much 100% surface erosion extraction. Heat and turbulence are required for inner cell extraction which creates coffee’s complexity (bitterness, acidity, etc). The idea with the above recipe is that you can isolate the surface erosion extraction by doing the low temp pre-infusion. This will delicately extract the surface solubles. Then, you can safely extract the inner cell solubles without fear of over-extracting the surface solubles. That’s the gist of it anyways!</p></div>",Championship,"Standard, 6:00, Metal Filter","18g, Very Coarse, Something light","63 & 98°C / NaN°F, 205mL","Place an AeroPress® Coffee Maker paper filter on top of the Prismo metal filter.

may also prevent some bitterness coming through from the orange peel.</p><p>Feel free to get creative with this AeroPress recipe - experiment with different types of fruit to see what works best; you could also add some ice to your vessel for a great summer coffee refresher.</p><p><em>For the full steps, scroll past the instagram embed :)</em></p><blockquote class=""instagram-media""

Add a filter paper to the top of the bed of ground coffee. The filter paper helps distribute the water. (This step isn't essential so don't worry too much).

Place the bottle (lid down) into the chamber.
Add 600ml of water to the bottle (the water we saved earlier)
Now the tricky part. By unscrewing the lid slightly we should be able create a drip rate.
We want the drip rate to be about 1 drip per second. You probably need to check the drip rate after about 20 minutes.
When you get your drip rate running well let the water drip away. Check it every now and then to make sure everything is ok.

Optional: Gently swirl the AeroPress a few times to further de-gas, then slowly push out extra air in the chamber. (this makes flipping drip-free)

I didn&#39;t want to fiddle with a scale, a precarious inverted method, or fumble with creating a vacuum.<p>It can be brewed with any type of kettle, perhaps a pot, or even a hot water spout at a gas station or convenience store.</p><p>What makes the AeroPress so unique and great apart from its ingenious design and compact size, is it creates a cup that is part percolation, part immersion, and part pressurized filter brew with no bypass or gimmicks resulting in a good, clean cup offering outstanding clarity and texture with ease. This technique is designed to be simple and efficient.</p><p>I like to use the included AeroPress coffee scoop. Yes I know, <em>GASP</em> volumetric measurement may be astounding to some but this technique is about ease and utilizing the tools provided not technical precision (though they both have their merits). I have found the AeroPress coffee scoop to yield ~17 g of speciality, light to medium roast coffee. Maybe less for darker roasts. If using a darker roast try grinding a bit coarser say medium fine or dropping the water temp.</p></div><p></p></div>",From an Enthusiast,"Standard, 4:30, Paper Filter","17g, Fine - Medium Fine, Speciality, preferably light to medium roast","99°C / 210°F, 300mL","Grind 1 AeroPress coffee scoop of coffee (~17g) — fine.

Closer - AeroPress Espresso,"<div id=""recipeDescription"" class=""w-full max-w-3xl prose text-black""><p>Using a modified Aeropress plunger seal, I was able to get a rich, syrupy, esspresso-like flavor. Other Aeropress espresso recipes have similar strength to espresso, but seem to lack the complexity of a real shot. The donut seal is used to maintain the tamp when pouring water into the cylinder, and ensure complete separation of water and grounds until you begin pressing.</p><p>Keep in mind your Aeropress still needs a plunger seal on the end. So buy a new one and replace the old seal on your plunger, so you can modify the old seal.</p><p>This recipe uses a metal filter in the Aeropress cap and a paper seal above the grounds and below the donut seal.</p><p>Experiment with the grind, tamp, and water amount to get your desired strength and extraction. These parameters will also determine how much force you need to apply, and/or how long the extraction takes.</p><p>You will have to push quite a bit harder than a normal Aeropress recipe, so make sure your cup is sturdy (I use a stainless mug) and on a stable surface. Be careful when pressing so the cylinder and cup do not fly out.</p><p><strong>To modify the plunger seal</strong>: Using an Exacto knife, or other sharp blade, cut a round opening in the center of the seal. Leave the flared outside edge intact. The opening in the center should be large enough to prevent channeling water through the center of the puck, without leaving the seal too thin/flexible to stay in place. Be careful not to cut yourself!</p><p><strong>Give this recipe a try and leave a comment to let us know how you go!</strong></p></div>",From an Enthusiast,"Standard, 1:00, Metal Filter","20g, Fine, Espresso roast","96°C / 204°F, 50mL","Place the cap and metal filter on the chamber

Wet paper filter and stick to bottom of donut seal (flared end point down)

Insert plunger and press to saturate the puck, but stop before the water comes out of the cap
Wait 5-10 seconds

The reason why the metal filter is in the middle is that the AeroPress is easier to clean.
