You get all of the bright notes of the beans, but also the darker earthy and chocolate notes from the entire bean. You can then either drink as is for a rich brew or dilute with boiled water to taste.</p><p>I have found that this method doesn&#39;t overextract. You&#39;ll have to try it for yourself... but it makes an amazingly smooth and flavorful cup. My method emphasizes not overly disturbing the coffee bed - I&#39;m interested in the natural diffusion of the flavors rather than any forceful extraction. I don&#39;t stir the bed or the bloom with any utensil, but rather focus on agitating with a gentle swirl - the bit of water on the bottom before the grounds go in help ensure I get full immersion without too much mucking around. The short bloom then just helps with degassing, then the pour to the top gets the brewing started. After a minute, the grounds have really soaked up the water and have started to swell up.</p><p>After I flip the aeropress right side up, I can immediately see the grinds start to flocculate to the bottom creating a secondary filter bed. I swirl gently to get any wayward grinds into the aeropress before I take off the plunger. At this point I remove all of the foam off the top because I&#39;ve found that&#39;s where a lot of the muddy flavors sit. At this point, the coffee has already started draining into my cup. This coffee is usually really bright and fruity since it&#39;s been about a minute or two into extraction. I often will top up the aeropress to the top, being careful not to disturb the grounds at all. I&#39;ve stuck my spoon to taste the coffee towards the end of the drip, and the heavier earth tones are extracted later on into the brew. Because there is very minimal disturbance to the grounds once you set this up, you don&#39;t get any forced extractions of bitter flavors. The fine grounds are actually key to this brew method I think since it slows the speed the water is going through the bed, again making diffusion rather than extraction the emphasis here.</p><p>When the coffee is done extracting, it&#39;s still pretty warm.</p><p>It also makes a mean iced coffee.</p><p>Like I said, I haven&#39;t been able to recreate this flavor profile using any other method... give it a try and let me know what you think.&quot;</p><p><em><strong>Tried it?

Congratulations Tuomas!</p><p>📍This recipe uses <strong>two rinsed paper filters</strong>;</p><p>Tuomas mentioned a few key points about his recipe on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Ca2ZRPFtaAd/\">Instagram</a>. If you want to try this recipe at home it will be helpful to read the following tips first:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I just wanna clarify a few things about the recipe so everyone can get hands-on with it! 😎</p><p>1. Water profile! 💦</p><p>Because of the nature of this year&#39;s competition, everyone used distilled water with @thirdwavewater minerals creating their own water profile. There were 14 different variations to choose from and I was the only one who used 100% espresso profile. I think this is one of the biggest reasons why my brew stood out.</p><p>Of course, I tried different variations and I think (especially in this competition coffee) this water profile gave the most balanced taste of sour and sweet, which I was going for. So give it a try and see how it changes the whole coffee versus to regular tap water!</p><p>2. Grind size! ✨</p><p>This was a pain in the arse when submitting the recipe. When I were creating my recipe I was using <strong>@comandantegrinder (27 clicks is what I used!)</strong> to get the most precise grind size. Yes, we got these templates where you can see the grind size from 0 to 9 of the coffee grinded with @macapgrinders . But still, it was very difficult to choose the right one. So it was quite a rough guess.</p><p>Even though, I think the correct grind size is one the most important factors in the recipe!</p><p>3.WAC coffee! ☕️</p><p>This awesome and complex coffee from @bureaux.coffee was really light roasted. When I first tried it, I brewed it with my Finnish Championship recipe. It came out with this not-so-pleasant sour taste which you can compare to tannins in red wine. How to get that astrigency off of the brew there are few things to bear in mind. Water temperature, grind size and agitation. Everything you can find from my Finnish AP recipe.</p><p>So what comes to this WAC recipe, I found the best balance in the other extremity - medium+ coarse grind, low water temperature and little agitation.</p><p>When making this brew, be gentle with it. Hope you guys enjoy! ❤️</p></blockquote><p><strong>Tried it? Let us know what you think in the comments below!</strong></p></div>",

Avoid circular stirs !\nPlace the plunger a few millimeters deep onto the AeroPress chamber. This will cause a bit of water to escape; don’t sweat it.\nRemove the AeroPress from your scale, and give it a swirl to level the coffee bed.\nAt the 5 minutes mark, give the AeroPress another thorough swirl.\nAt the 9 minutes mark (or later), start pressing on the plunger gently.

It is a super quick and easy method to get a great flat white without an espresso machine.</p><p>For the milk part <strong>Eric</strong>, who shared this recipe, uses a small french press for frothing in this recipe. You can use a flask if you don&#39;t have a french press.</p><p>When using a flask, be aware of these few things as Ales from European Coffee Trip mentioned in their blog:</p><blockquote><p>The main thing is that you need to have a flask that you can fully close. I found these two small insulated flasks at home that were ideal. You shouldn’t fill the flask over halfway, because you need to leave some space inside for proper shaking, and also to accommodate the pressure building up inside of the flask. If it is too hot, you can use a kitchen towel to protect your hands.</p></blockquote><p>Thanks <strong>Eric</strong> for submitting this recipe to AeroPrecipe!</p><p><strong>Tried this recipe?

Prismo creates a perfect seal inside the AeroPress chamber, so once you load in your coffee and grinds, there’s no worries about coffee leaking out the bottom. Play with different grind sizes and immersion times to coax out the best flavor from your favorite beans. Plus, once your coffee is done, when you press through Prismo’s Pressure Actuated Valve, the coffee is aerated as it passes through. Resulting in less bitterness and a smoother, creamier cup.</p></div>",

Wait for 10 minutes.\nAfter 10 minutes, gently press all the way down. No need to press hard.\nThat's it. You're done!",

      "steps": "Add your coffee to an inverted AeroPress. For a cold brew with the Aeropress, go 1.5x-2x the volume of ground coffee you'd normally use for a hot brew. In this example, we're using 30g of coffee for 150g (ml) of water. That's a ratio of 20g per 100ml.\nAdd all of your water (150ml) to the AeroPress.\nStir the slurry quite vigorously for the first 30 seconds or so. Then continue doing one or two stirs every 5-10 seconds letting the coffee steep and extract for up to 60 seconds.\nAdd the filter after about a minute (or more) of steep time. How much steep time? Depends on your coffee and your taste. Experiment!\nAs the coffee continues to steep for another 30 seconds or so, add your ice to your glass to fill it up.\nFlip your AeroPress and slowy plunge.\nOnce you've finished plunging, keep a bit of the airspace between coffee and the plunger - this way, you keep the bloom out of the cup, which can lead to more bitters.\nAdd some milk - this is optional, but the sweetness milk can really gives a boost to the cup.\nStir the brewed coffee until you start seeing condensation on the glass, and serve.",

Other Aeropress espresso recipes have similar strength to espresso, but seem to lack the complexity of a real shot. The donut seal is used to maintain the tamp when pouring water into the cylinder, and ensure complete separation of water and grounds until you begin pressing.</p><p>Keep in mind your Aeropress still needs a plunger seal on the end. So buy a new one and replace the old seal on your plunger, so you can modify the old seal.</p><p>This recipe uses a metal filter in the Aeropress cap and a paper seal above the grounds and below the donut seal.</p><p>Experiment with the grind, tamp, and water amount to get your desired strength and extraction. These parameters will also determine how much force you need to apply, and/or how long the extraction takes.</p><p>You will have to push quite a bit harder than a normal Aeropress recipe, so make sure your cup is sturdy (I use a stainless mug) and on a stable surface. Be careful when pressing so the cylinder and cup do not fly out.</p><p><strong>To modify the plunger seal</strong>: Using an Exacto knife, or other sharp blade, cut a round opening in the center of the seal. Leave the flared outside edge intact. The opening in the center should be large enough to prevent channeling water through the center of the puck, without leaving the seal too thin/flexible to stay in place. Be careful not to cut yourself!</p><p><strong>Give this recipe a try and leave a comment to let us know how you go!</strong></p></div>",

Discard water and set cap aside.\nWith the Aeropress inverted, pour 50g of your boiled water into your AeropPress and stir thoroughly. This bloom period will last for 30s.\nAt the 0:30 mark, pour the remaining 100g of water rather quickly in concentric circles. When your total volume of water is in the chamber, give it one deep stir and then cap your AeroPress.\nAt 2:30 flip your AeroPress on top of your server and press steadily for 30s over 150g if ice. Stop your press when the AeroPress hisses!\nGive your iced coffee a good swirl in your server to exchange those final molecules of heat for some cooler ones and then serve in a chilled glass.",

My English is not very good, so hopefully it will be understandable :).</p><p>The recipe is purely experimental. I am a hobbyist and new to using an AeroPress and drinking filtered coffee. I wanted to try some espresso-like recipe. For this recipe, I used Ethiopia Sidamo coffee from a roaster in the Czech Republic. I enjoyed the coffee using this recipe so I decided to share it.</p><p>It is a standard recipe uusing 14 grams of coffee, 60 ml/85 degrees water and fast pressure. Quick and short.</p><p>An interesting thing I&#39;ve tried here is using a combination of a paper and metal filters. I used the standard method of inserting a metal filter between two paper filters. It occurred to me that if I use a combination of paper and metal filter, I can get a little more pressure through the filters. The reason why the metal filter is in the middle is that the AeroPress is easier to clean. When cleaning, you first tear off the paper filter from the bottom, then take a clean metal filter and finally push the rest into the trash.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p><strong>T﻿ried this recipe?
